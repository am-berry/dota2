# dota2 - predicting whether radiant team wins a game or not

Some light feature engineering, building an understanding of how everything comes together

To-do list:

- hyperparameter tuning
- try other models - particularly neural nets (lots of feature interaction)
- gain an understanding of what the x,y coords entail
