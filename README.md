# dota2 - predicting whether radiant team wins a game or not

Some light feature engineering, building an understanding of how everything comes together.
nb: this repository holds very early stages of the project, reflected in scores:

this repository: 0.82~ 
curr max: 0.85135 (no tuning, few features)

To-do list:

- which feats make up objectives_len (curr: towers, roshans, fb not: rune_pickups)
- hyperparameter tuning
- neural nets (lots of interaction between features)
- how x,y coords contribute to model
